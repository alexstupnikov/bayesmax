The BRUniBP system is a two-level classifier, first separating the groups of languages using the tfidf weighting scheme.

The second level combines several character and word-level methods and uses a maximum entropy classifier on their output.
* Character level methods includes raw n-gram models and a variant of Katz's backoff smoothing.
* Individual character n-grams up to trigrams
* Word bigrams
* Word bigrams of the 200 most frequent words in each language (mostly stopwords)
* Tfidf weights
